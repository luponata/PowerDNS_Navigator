# PowerDNS_Navigator
PowerDNS (v1.5.3) terminal (Cmd) frontend

This repo contains some "fast written" functions, i'm going to clean them a bit in the future, time permitting.

This project was initially mean for personal use and was built in 3 days due to some urgent let'sencrypt SSL certs automations, without which they couldn't have worked.

#### The script was built based on the HTTP calls of PowerDNS v1.5.3, different versions may not work
